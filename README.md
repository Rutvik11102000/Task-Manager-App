Task Manager
Welcome to the Task Manager project! Task Manager is a tool to help you manage your tasks and stay organized.

What Task Manager Uses
Task Manager is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a modern, responsive design to ensure that you can access and manage your tasks from any device with a web browser.
Technical Stacks
HTML: HyperText Markup Language is used for the structure and layout of the application.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling and visual design of the application.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used for adding interactivity to the application.
Four Sections
Task Manager is divided into four main sections:

Open: This section shows all tasks that are not yet in progress.
In Progress: This section shows all tasks that are currently being worked on.
In Review: This section shows all tasks that are ready for review.
Done: This section shows all tasks that have been completed.

Task Description
You can add a description to each task to provide more details about what needs to be done. Simply click on the task to view its details, and then enter your description in the "Description" field.
